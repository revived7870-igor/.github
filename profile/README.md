## Hello there :O

This is an organization related to uhhh, exonys7870 devices me and my friends have

## Supported devices (as of 11.06.2024):

* [Functionality status](https://github.com/revived7870-igor/.github/blob/master/profile/Functionality.md)<br>

## What to do?

Thank @A2L5E0X1 for initially starting it all, if not him i wouldn't get an a3 in the first place.
