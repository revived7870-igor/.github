## What works?

- RIL (Dual sim)
- Audio (janky - audio_amplifier implementation sucks)
- BT/WIFI
- USB
- Camera (expect broken gscaler (stretched preview/content in some resolutions)
- Fingerprint
- Sensors
- Lights
- NFC
- GPS
  
...idk what else to check for

## What's broken?

- Encryption (FDE is shit, FBE needs a look, either way something's up with keystore configuration i guess)
- Auto brightness
- FM Radio (couldn't care less tbh)

## PLUHðŸ—£

a6lte is untested since the initial build is too buggy by itself + i don't have the device + my friend couldn't care less to bother with fixing it
